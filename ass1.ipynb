        "The paper proposes multilayer neural network trained with the backpropagation algorithm that can be used to recognise high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters. Furthermore, this paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition, the results of the methods are compared to a handwritten digit recognition standard task. The challenge of this research is constructing a better pattern recognition system that can rely more on automatic learning but less on hand-designed heuristics at the same time. In this case of study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are mainly used in this task, such as by using the combination of Convolutional Neural Network pattern/character recognizer and global training techniques to estimate result accuracy on personal checks and business. \n",
        "The paper contains 10 main sections, which covers multiple topics and techniques in patterns and characters recognition. In this report will only focus on the sections of convolutional neural network. By review the convolutional neural network section, the technique that being used in the research is LeNet-5, which is the first generation of CNN that developed in 1998. CNN is a deep learning model or multi-layer perceptron, it is one of the representative algorithms of deep learning, which is commonly used to analyse visual images. In this paper, the research group uses LeNet-5 to extract the features of handwritten characters by training on the regular MINIST database in 5 layers. Shown in figure 1 below, a general LeNet-5 CNN approach for image classification has 3 main layers: Convolutional Layers, Subsampling Layers (or Pooling Layer) and Fully-Connected layers. <br>\n",
        "  * Convolutional Layer: In the convolution layer, the matrix is generated by calculating the region of the input image and the weight matrix of the filter, and the result is taken as the output of this layer. Normally the input used to be a matrix of N*M*3 image, where N and M are the units (pixels) of the height and width. 3 is the colour channels that represent to red, green and blue. In this case of study, the use of training data in LeNet-5 model is grey scale handwritten digit pattern, therefore, the input is 1 channel and input for LeNet-5 model is a 32*32 grayscale image with 6 feature maps or filters having size 5*5 in the first layer.  There are some filters that apply in convolution layer, these filters are used to extract the features of the image, such as curves and stripes. The output of the first convolutional layer changes from 32*32*1 to 28*28*6.<br>\n",
        "  <br>\n",
        "  There are 2 convolutional layers in LeNet-5 model, as the figure 1 describes, the second convolutional layer contains 16 feature maps with 5*5 size and a stride of 1. Therefore, in this layer, 16 features maps are used to connect to the 6 features maps from the previous layer (subsampling layer) and output 16 features in 10*10 size. <br>\n",
        "  <br>\n",
        "  * Subsampling Layer: The subsampling Layer has the another name “Pooling Layer” in the recently study of CNN. Generally, there are two widely used pooling approaches: max pooling and average pooling, where max pooling is the most used of the two and having a better performance in most the cases. The subsampling layer is used to reduce the dimensions of feature space in the convolution neural network, but does not reduce the depth(channel). The output of the subsampling can be used for the next convolution layer or the fully connected layer. In this case of study, the size of the LeNet-5 subsampling matrix is in size of 2*2.<br>\n",
        "  <br>\n",
        "  *\tFully-connected layer: Fully connected layer is taking the most important role, it flattens the output of the last convolutional layer and connect to number of nodes that the researchers want to classify. The output of the fully connect layer is generated by training these number of nodes and use “softmax” to gain the probability of the result.<br>\n",

Now many of the contents of the neural network can be seen in the network structure of LeNet-5, such as convolution layer, Pooling layer and ReLU layer. Although LeNet-5 was introduced as early as the 1990s, the lack of large-scale training data at that time, the performance of computer hardware is also low, so LeNet-5 neural network is not ideal when dealing with complex problems.<br>\n",

In this case, 5 layers of convolution are not enough for large scale and complicate patterns and images classification.   \n"

In the year of 1980s, due the performance of computer hardware LeNet-5 can input small scale of image or patterns such as 32*32 pixel.  After 2 steps of each convolutions and subsampling, the features map(filters) finally generates a 16*6 matrix which represents the features of selecting pattern or image. Furthermore, as the network deepens in LeNet-5, the accuracy of the training set decreases, this will be known as Network degradation.  In today’s research, small scale patterns will not satisfy the modern deep learning development, it needs more trainable hidden layers and developed feature maps to extract different types of features from the large scale of patterns such as ResNet50. To solve the Network degradation (such as ResNet50) problem, deep residual network is designed to overcome the problem that the learning efficiency is low due to the deepening of the network, and the accuracy cannot be effectively improved.  \n"
